# cfs-unhinged
User mod for the Creality CFS, to store and use in tight places.

# Motivation
I have four CFS units and it's very difficult for me to place them in a manner that will make it 
easy to change filament spools without moving around, disconnecting things, and pulling on
the PTFE tubes, thereby introducing the risk of kinks on the PTFE tubes or wearing down the connectors.

This project was my solution to keep the CFS static, only requiring around 13.5" of vertical space 
in order to exchange filament spools.

# Procedure

## Disassembling the CFS
The best way to dissasemble the CFS would be to follow Creality's own instructional video for
replacin the RFID board at: \
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_A2CEYbSsFI \
**You only need to watch it until timestamp 2:20.** \
Disconnect the red+black power cord shown at that timestamp so you will have the lid 
and chamber separated from the shell.

## Removing the Lid
You are now ready to proceed with the removal of the lid. Open the lid away from the chamber
while securing the assembly so it doesn't flip over because of the weight of the lid.

You will see that the lid is held in place by two pins which are not
user-accessible from the outside during CFS operation. To make the
CFS "unhinged" we will need to remove these two pins. (You can always
put them back on later if you feel that this mod is not for you)

To remove the pins we just need to push them out of the hinges,
always being careful because we're dealing with plastic parts,
even though the pins themselves are made of metal.

#### Two Types of CFS lids
At this point I need to mention that I have encountered two types of CFS lids.
* **Type 1** - They have pre-made hole through which you can push the pins out with
an appropriate sized tool. (see picture above)
* **Type 2** - The pins are inside the hinge with no access from the inside.
For these types, you will need to drill a very small hole through which to push them out of
the hinges. This may sound scary to some, but it's really just a very small
hole and very easily done. I have found that a  3/32" (or 2.3 mm metric)
drill bit is the best size to match the factory holes on Type 1 units.

You only need to remove a little bit of plastic, just enough to get access to the pin (see photo above). Go slow with the dill bit. An electric screwdriver with a drill bit is preferred, as the acrylic is soft and you can
proceed very slow to prevent accidental damaged.

## Pushing and pulling the pins out
To push the pins out you can use a hex key that will fit in the hole, or use a small pick
tool either straight or angled, as shown in the photos.

Once the pins are peaking out of the hinge (see photos) you can pull them out with pliers.

They should pull out easily but if you find out that they are not try to support the
lid better or move it at a different angle until the pins slide out with just a little
pulling force.

Please save the pins in case you want to restore them later.

## Reassembly
You're now ready to reassemble the CFS by following the process show in the video
but in reverse. Don't forget to start by reconnecting the power cord. When you finish,
make sure to reconnect the CFS to your system and power everything
up again to make sure that the CFS is being recognized.

## Yay!
You are now ready to enjoy the great convenience and productivity of an "Unhinged CFS"

# Q/A:

* **Isn't the lid too loose and filaments exposed to outside humidity?** - My tests from reading
the hummidity readings of the CFS have revealed that the weight of the lid over the rubber gasket seal, plus the grip of
both side-latches, are enough to keep it sealed and preserve the internal filament environment. 

* **Will this invalidate warranty?** - Almost certainly, especially if any drilling took place.

* **What are other benefits?** - With the lid out, I expect the community to be motivated to come up with
other mods, in the age-old creativity spirit of the Creality user community
